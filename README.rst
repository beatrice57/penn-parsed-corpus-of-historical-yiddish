Dedication
==========

The work in the repository is dedicated to my teachers at Penn, with
gratitude, respect, and affection, and especially:

- Henry Hoenigswald (1915-2003)
- Ellen Prince (1944-2010)
- Anthony Kroch (1946-2021)

Description
===========

The corpus contains roughly 200,000 words of historical (and modern)
Yiddish.  By far the largest contribution comes from two 20th-century
texts, 1910e-grine-felder (15,611 words) and 1947e-royte-pomerantsn
(67,558 words).

The origin of the corpus is as a collection of linguistically relevant
examples that I collected in connection with research on the changing
syntax of subordinate clauses in the history of Yiddish.  Although
most files have been updated to contain running text, some of them
still reflect their origin, containing only subordinate clauses.

The corpus can be searched with CorpusSearch.

I am also very fortunate to have had the assistance of Talia Beck, who
possesses a rare combination of proficiency in both Hebrew and Yiddish
as well as knowledge of Jewish culture and who was therefore able to
supply many glosses for the Hebrew material in the Yiddish texts.
