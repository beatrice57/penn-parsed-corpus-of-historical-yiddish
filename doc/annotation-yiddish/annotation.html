<h3>Annotation guidelines for the Penn Parsed Corpus of Historical Yiddish</h3>

Unless otherwise specified below, the Penn Parsed Corpus of Historical Yiddish
is annotated according to the guidelines for the
<a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~beatrice/annotation/index.html"
target="_new">Penn Parsed Historical Corpora of English</a> (PPCHE).

<h3>Splitting and joining</h3>

In orthographic words that need to be split to conform to the parsing
guidelines (notably particle-verb combinations), the site of the split
is indicated by a trailing "@" on the first item and a leading "@" on
the second one.

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (PP (P mit@)
      (NP (D @n) (N andern))))

( (RP oyf@) (TO @tsu@) (VB @shteyn))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Conversely, sequences of words that are ordinarily spelled as a single
orthographic word are joined with an underscore.

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (ADVP (ADV eyn_zu)))

( (VBN fr_zamlt))
</pre>

All punctuation is uniformly tagged PUNC.  In order to facilitate
interaction with Unix, exclamation points are rendeded as "%EXCL%".
Otherwise, the

Linguistic examples in discussions of Yiddish grammar
(1927e-zaretski-sholem, 1928e-zaretski-mendele, 1932e-shtif, 1946e-mark)
are marked as such by the suffix -EXAMPLE on the appropriate label
(IP-MAT-EXAMPLE, and so on).

<p>
Free translations from Hebrew or other languages are marked as such with
the suffix -TRANSL on the appropriate label (IP-MAT-TRANSL, NP-TRANSL,
and so on).  See below for word-for-word glosses and translations.

<p>
Finally, material of the following types is marked with an IGNORE-
prefix:

<ul>
<li>IGNORE-ANACHRONISM - quotations in Modern Yiddish sources of Early Yiddish material
<li>IGNORE-TRANSL - word-for-word glosses or translations of Hebrew
    material (kheyder-taytsh)
<li>IGNORE-UNGRAMM - ungrammatical examples in discussions of Yiddish grammar

<h3>Disfluencies and parentheticals</h3>

<h4>CP-QUE-MAT-THT (indirect question with inversion)</h4>

<blockquote>

Indirect questions are generally annotated as CP-QUE-SUB.  But in cases
where they exhibit the word order of direct questions (with subject-verb
inversion), they are annotated as CP-QUE-MAT on a par with direct
questions, but with the added dash tag -THT to indicate their complement
status (analogously to the case of <a href="#ip-mat-tht">IP-MAT-THT</a>).

<a name="doubling">
<h4>Doubled constituent</h4>

In noun phrases conforming to the template "Det N Det N", the second
"Det N" sequence is annotated as NP-DBL.  The nouns in questions are
sometimes tagged as adjectives, or are modified by adjectives.  It is
not always clear whether a noun phrase is doubled (-DBL) or an ordinary
parenthetical (-PRN; the default (for ease of recovery) is -DBL.

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (CONJ ober)
          (NP-SBJ (NPR moyshe-rabeynu))
          (BEP iz)

          (PUNC ,))
  (ID 1947E-ROYTE-POMERANTSEN,248.6440))
</pre>
</blockquote>

Note the contrast with instances containing only a single noun.

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (NP-SBJ (D ayner) (D a) (N yid)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

Verbs can also be doubled.  The verb in the noncanonical (generally,
clause-initial) position is the one that counts as doubled.

<a name="diagnostic-adverb">
<h4>-DIAGN</h4>

<blockquote>

The tag -DIAGN distinguishes the sentential adverbs DEN, DOKH, EFSHER,
MISTOME, NOCH, SHOYN, YO, which play the same role as sentence-level NEG
in diagnosing whether the finite verb has moved to sentence-medial INFL
(or possibly higher).

</blockquote>

<a name="dr+p">
<h4>DR+P</h4>

<blockquote>

In general, the corpus contains no compound tags ("plus" tags) to
indicate word-internal structure.  The sole exception concerns words
consisting of a demonstrative or interrogative adverb (corresponding to
German DA/WO or English THERE/WHERE) combined with a preposition or
particle.  The intent is to facilitate the analysis of selectional
restrictions imposed by a governing verb.

Following <a href="https://linguist.is/icelandic_treebank/Icelandic_Parsed_Historical_Corpus_(IcePaHC)"
target="_new">IcePaHC</a>, ES is used in the following constructions:

<ul>
<p>
<li>impersonal passive
<li>existential construction, including transitive expletive construction
<li>clausal extraposition -
    The expletive NP (generally a subject, but possibly an object) is
    coindexed with the extraposed clause.
    Extraposition is also possible in connection with demonstrative
    pronouns.  Such pronouns are also coindexed with their clausal
    associates, but tagged as D rather than ES.

<a name="hebrew">

Hebrew words are tagged as H, and a gloss is appended with a linking
caret.  Unknown glosses are indicated by UNKNOWN.

Hebrew bound morphemes are split only if attached to Germanic words, as
sometimes occurs.

In general, Hebrew material does not have Yiddish sister constituents.

Possessive NPs are annotated uniformly as NP-POS without distinction as
to morphological case - genitive (whether etymologically motivated or
not), dative, and so on.  For uniformity and ease of retrieval, all
possessive NPs, whether consisting of a one word or more, are annotated
with a phrasal projection.  In principle, possessive NPs can follow the
head they modify, but in the corpus, they all precede their head.

<h4>Relative clause (CP-REL)</h4>

</blockquote>

<p>
This is not the vernacular type, however.  Rather, relative clauses in
the vernacular are introduced by the indeclinable complementizer VOS,
analogous to English THAT.  In Old Yiddish, the complementizer can also
be realized as AZ or DZ.

<blockquote>
<pre>

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In Old Yiddish, complementizer VOS is distinguished from the wh- pronoun
corresponding to German WAS.  In particular, VOS and orthographic
variants of it are treated as wh- pronouns in relative clauses modifying
quantifier and also in a very few other cases where German would allow
WAS (cf. <i>alles, was ich habe</i>, <i>das, was ich habe</i>).  In
texts after 1800, VOS is invariably treated as a complementizer.

<p>
As in many vernacular varieties, relative clauses in Yiddish can be
"chopped" in the sense of Ross 1967.  In other words, an expected
preposition more or less closely related to the verb is missing.  When
the preposition is arguably selected by the verb, such cases are
annotated with a silent WPP antecedent.

Relative clauses with resumptive elements, which are common in Modern
Yiddish, are annotated (as in the PPCHE) by coindexing the wh-
antecedent and the resumptive element.

The VOS FAR construction is uniformly annotated as a wh- head VOS with a

In other words, the discontinuous case is not treated as left branch
extraction.  This is consistent with the fact that the construction
occurs in varieties of Germanic that do not otherwise exhibit left
branch extraction.
