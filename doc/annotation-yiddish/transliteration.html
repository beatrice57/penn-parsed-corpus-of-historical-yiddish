<h3>Transliteration</h3>

In general, the transliteration of the texts follows the system devised
by YIVO.  Users should that the YIVO system provides no one-to-one
mapping from Hebrew to Roman letters.

<p>
For two of the texts, 1910e-grine-felder and 1947e-royte-pomerantsen, I
am indebted to Ellen Prince for providing online texts transliterated
according to YIVO system.  I believe that Prince herself entered
1910e-grine-felder, and I know for a fact that she revised the OCR'd
text of the print version underlying 1947e-royte-pomerantsen to follow
the YIVO system.

<p>
The texts reprinted in Birnbaum 1979 have been revised (by me) to follow
the YIVO system.

<p>
The remaining texts were transliterated by myself from page images of
early or later printed works, more or less according to the YIVO system.
If I could live life over again, I would attempt to develop more
systematic transliteration guidelines for the Old Yiddish texts.  As it
is, the main aim of the transliteration was to quickly produce a
Romanized version of the text that wes useful without spending too much
time on recording orthographic details of the underlying text.  Readers
interested in such detail should consult the page images available for
most of the texts.

<p>
Hebrew words are transliterated ignoring diacritics, even when these
appear in the text.

<p>
In what follows, angle brackets (&lsaquo;, &rsaquo;) indicate Roman
letters.  Hebrew letters and diacritics are simply referred to by name.

<h4>Vowels</h4>

<ul>
<li>Silent (shtumer) aleph, whether initial or final, is omitted.
<li>Pasekh and komets are typically absent from Early Yiddish texts.
    They come into use in Modern Yiddish, and I have not always reliably
    transliterated them, especially in sources from the early 1800s, even
    when they appear in the text.  As a result, &lsaquo;a&rsaquo; and
    &lsaquo;ey&rsaquo; can appear where the YIVO system would
    transliterate as &lsaquo;o&rsaquo; and &lsaquo;ay&rsaquo;,
    respectively.
<li>Depending (though not always reliably) on context
     <ul>
     <li>yud is transliterated as &lsaquo;i&rsaquo; or &lsaquo;y&rsaquo;
     <li>vov is transliterated as &lsaquo;u&rsaquo; or &lsaquo;v&rsaquo;
     </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Ambiguity between basic forms and variants</h4>

The following basic letters are not reliably distinguished from variants
conventionally marked with diacritics in Modern Yiddish, especially
since diacritics are often missing in Early Yiddish.

<ul>
<li>beys (&lsaquo;b&rsaquo;) - veys (&lsaquo;v&rsaquo;)
<li>vov (&lsaquo;u&rsaquo;, &lsaquo;v&rsaquo;) - melupm vov (&lsaquo;v&rsaquo;)
<li>khof (&lsaquo;kh&rsaquo;) - kof (&lsaquo;k&rsaquo;)
<li>fey (&lsaquo;f&rsaquo;) - pey (&lsaquo;p&rsaquo;)
<li>shin (&lsaquo;sh&rsaquo;) - sin (&lsaquo;s&rsaquo;)
<li>sof (&lsaquo;s&rsaquo;) - tof (&lsaquo;t&rsaquo;)
</ul>

<h4>Ambiguity among different Hebrew letters</h4>

<ul>
<li>&lsaquo;k&rsaquo; - kof, kuf
<li>&lsaquo;s&rsaquo; - samekh, sin, sof
<li>&lsaquo;t&rsaquo; - tes, tof
</ul>

<h4>Ambiguity between one letter or two</h4>

Some of the following ambiguities may not in fact occur given the
convention that certain Hebrew letters are used only in words of Semitic
origin.


<ul>
<li>&lsaquo;kh&rsaquo; - khes, khof, kof + hey
<li>&lsaquo;sh&rsaquo; - shin, samekh + hey, sin + hey, sof + hey
<li>&lsaquo;th&rsaquo; - tof (counter to YIVO), tes + hey
</ul>
